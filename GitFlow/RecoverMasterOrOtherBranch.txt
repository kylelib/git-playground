# What if I delete a Remote branch like Master?
#   If you still have local copy of the branch simply push it up again.
#
#   If not then there are a couple options:
#   1. Create a new "master" branch and push it up

       git checkout -b master <SHA or commit id>
       git push origin master

#   2. This does this does the same without doing a checkout (not tested)

       git branch master <SHA or commit id>
       git push origin master
